train 	25	NEG	FALSE	Gay marriage is something that people came up with years ago, but 2000 years ago, marriage was the union of a guy and a woman not two guys or two women. The world now a days is creating so many new ideas and making up things that long time ago didn't exist, such as gay marriage. In some cases guy start to wear make up and acting like girls, which is something that is not right. People get plastic surgeries to look like the opposite sex and honestly, that's wrong because we were made the way we are and we shouldn't change how we look or how we act just because we want to be someone that we're not.	Gay marriage is something that people came up with years ago, but 2000 yeats ago, marriage was the union of a guy and a woman not two guys or two woman. But a lot has changed in the last two thousand years. People have more rights, more freedom and a lot more things are accepted by our society. This is why they can decide who they want to marry, how they want to look like and what gender they want to have. They have the freedom to develop their own character and are not limited by social conventions.

Some traditions should never be changed and one of them is the tradition of marriage. It just should be the union of a man and a woman and not between gays. Changing those traditions leads to gay marriage, men wearing make up and acting like woman and gender transformation. Those changes are harming our society because they go against the social conventions we live after.

We do not need old social conventions and should make use of our freedom and rights. Those include gay marriage, men being allowed to wear make up, gender transformation and many more. It should not be forbidden just because old people who were raised with diffenrent morals and social conventions think it is not right.

There is no reason why we should change a running concept like marriage. It worked for 2000 years and it will work for another 2000 or more years. Changing it just because some minorities do not like those conventions and concepts is not necessary. God has given everybody one gender. It is not something that you should and could change.

There are several reasons why we should change the concept of marriage. Yes it worked for 2000 years but just because the people who were against it were repressed and simply did not have the right to say anything bad about the standard marriage. A lot has changed in the past 2000 years and the repressed people gained a lot more rights to tell people their opinion about the old fashionied marriage. We can not ignore those people and we have to build a society with rules that fit everybody not just those people with the most power.

It should not be if you feel more comfartable.
