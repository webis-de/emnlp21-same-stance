The repository for the EMNLP 2021 paper "On Classifying whether Two Texts are on the Same Side of an Argument"

## Data

Our artificial test set is in [data/](data/).

## Code

We have three different code branches:

### [baseline](code/baseline)

Here, the code is based on the baseline implementation at: [argmining19-same-side-classification](https://github.com/webis-de/argmining19-same-side-classification)

### [experiment1](code/experiment1)

This code contains notebooks for experiment1.

See setup instructions in [`code/experiment1/README.md`](code/experiment1/README.md).
The notebook [`code/experiment1/00_index.ipynb`](code/experiment1/00_index.ipynb) should give a brief overview over the experiments.

### [experiment2](code/experiment2)

This code contains [notebook](code/experiment2/same-side-classification_exp2.ipynb) for running experiment2.

See notes in [`code/experiment2/README.md`](code/experiment2/README.md).
