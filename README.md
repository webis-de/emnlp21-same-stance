# EMNLP 2021 - On Classifying whether Two Texts are on the Same Side of an Argument

The repository for the EMNLP 2021 paper "On Classifying whether Two Texts are on the Same Side of an Argument"

## Data

Our artificial test set is in [data/](data/).

## Code

We have three different code branches:

### [baseline](code/baseline)

Here, the code is based on the baseline implementation at: [argmining19-same-side-classification](https://github.com/webis-de/argmining19-same-side-classification)

### [experiment1](code/experiment1)

This code contains experiments using [Huggingface transformers](https://huggingface.co/).

See setup instructions in [`code/experiment1/README.md`](code/experiment1/README.md).
The notebook [`code/experiment1/00_index.ipynb`](code/experiment1/00_index.ipynb) should give a brief overview over the experiments.
